RedditTweetBot
==============
This bot was ultimately banned from /r/nba, where I had it running. While it was active,
it crawled the New posts in /r/nba looking for links to tweets. It then commented
some basic stats concerning the success of posts for the tweeter linked. 
The idea was to show the credibility of the tweeters linked, as there were many
links to tweets during this time period, and not all were reliable.
